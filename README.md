## Description

AS An RPG Gamer
I WANT to be taken to a page to create a character or use a pregenerated character
SO THAT I can play through a text based dungeon crawl, collect loot and fight monsters.

## Usage

An introductory page is presented and the user where they can login or create an account. The application will validate the user. After creating an account, the user can create a charatcer, start a campaign with an existing character, or take a look at the loot they gained on previous adventures. The user can create their own charater by filing out a form and rolling ability scores when prompted or use a character that is pre-generated. 

When the user starts the campaign they will be guided through the dungeon by answering a series of questions that will reveal new options. The character's success will be determined by the automated rolls, ability scores, and overall choices they make through out the dungeon. If the character survives the dungeon, a congratulatory message will appear across the screen and the user will recieve loot in their loot bag.
